## Entry Into Product 🔽🔽🔽

Our team is developing a full-stack web application to modernize and replace the existing mailroom package management system used by our university. The goal is to streamline how mailroom employees intake, process, and distribute packages for students and staff on campus — reducing manual entry, errors, and delays.

This system will serve as a centralized platform for tracking package arrivals, automating notifications, managing pickups, and generating data insights for the mail services department.

### Product Overview in our WIKI (link me later)

(Will include screenshots, process diagrams, and database schema once finalized.)
